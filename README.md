## Project Motivation
Our motivation for this project was to inform the general public of the rise of school shootings since Columbine in 1999.  There have been 389 school shootings since this fatal incident. This project allows a user to analyze the data of school shootings in the United States from 1999 to 2023. They will be able to interact by choosing states to see the school shootings in that state. A map to see the locations of school shootings with a maker-size to show the number of casualties.  

## Technology
